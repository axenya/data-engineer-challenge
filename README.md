# Data Engineer Code Review Challenge

Welcome to the Data Engineer Code Review Challenge! This repository is designed to assess the skills of candidates applying for a Data Engineer position. The goal of this challenge is to review and provide feedback on the code provided in an open pull request (PR).

## Challenge Overview

In this repository, you will find an open pull request containing two files:
1. `python-snippet.py`: A Python code snippet for an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process.
2. `sql-snippet.sql`: A SQL script that creates tables and performs a SELECT operation on them.

## Your Task

Your task is to review the code in the pull request and provide your feedback. This includes identifying any issues, suggesting improvements, and highlighting any strengths you observe in the code. Your review should focus on aspects such as code quality, performance, readability, and adherence to best practices.

## How to Complete the Challenge

1. **Fork this repository** to your own GitHub account.
2. **Clone your forked repository** to your local machine.
3. **Navigate to the open pull request** and review the changes in the `python-snippet.py` and `sql-snippet.sql` files.
4. **Add your review comments** directly on the pull request in GitHub.
5. **Submit your review** on the pull request.

## Evaluation Criteria

Your code review will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
- **Thoroughness**: Did you catch all potential issues and suggest reasonable improvements?
- **Clarity**: Are your comments and suggestions clear and easy to understand?
- **Constructiveness**: Are your feedback and suggestions constructive and helpful?

## Tips for a Great Review

- **Readability**: Ensure the code is easy to read and understand. Suggest improvements for variable names, function names, and overall structure if needed.
- **Performance**: Identify any potential performance issues and suggest optimizations.
- **Best Practices**: Ensure the code follows industry best practices and standards.
- **Error Handling**: Check for proper error handling and suggest improvements if necessary.
